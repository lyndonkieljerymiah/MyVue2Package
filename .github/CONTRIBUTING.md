### Pull requests guidelines
* Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, and merge back against that branch.
* It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.
* Work in ``src`` folder never touch or commit in ``dist`` folder


### Development setup
* You will need [node-js](http://nodejs.org/) v6.10+ and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) v1.x
* Make changes in ``src`` folder
* Write/update test case for the feature/fix you made 
* You can check if everything is working fine by running tests - `yarn test`
